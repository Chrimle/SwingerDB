# SwingerDB
### *The only database engine that refuses to settle down.*

> 🧓 Boomers love rigid schema.
> 
> 🧑‍💻 Millennials prefer flexibility.
> 
> 🧠 Gen Z? They just want something that vibes.

*SwingerDB is the world's first polyamorous database engine—proudly relational and non-relational, depending on its mood. Today it's SQL with strong ACID guarantees. Tomorrow it's JSON over a WebSocket.*

*Who are you to define its relationships?*

---

*Whether you're a Boomer clinging to your primary keys, a Millennial swiping right on document stores, or Gen Z just trying to make your API aesthetic, SwingerDB welcomes all.*

***Monogamous databases are so 20th century!***
